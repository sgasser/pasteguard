PasteGuard masks personal data and secrets before sending prompts to LLM providers.

```
You send:  "Email Dr. Sarah Chen at sarah@hospital.org"
LLM sees:  "Email [[PERSON_1]] at [[EMAIL_ADDRESS_1]]"
You get:   Response with original names restored
```

PasteGuard sits between your app and the LLM API:

Two privacy modes:

| Mode | How it works |
|------|--------------|
| **Mask** | Replace PII with placeholders, send to provider, restore in response |
| **Route** | PII requests stay on your local LLM (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp), others go to your configured provider |

## Browser Extension (Beta)

An open source browser extension that brings PasteGuard protection to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Perplexity.

- Paste customer data → PII is masked before it reaches the AI
- You see the original, AI sees `[[PERSON_1]]`, `[[EMAIL_1]]`

Open source (Apache 2.0). Built in public — early feedback shapes the product.
